Create RLS : Enable delete access for users based on their user Id
To enable delete access for users based on their user Id, you can create a policy using the using clause. Here's an example of how to do this:

-- 1. Create table
create table profiles (
  id uuid primary key,
  user_id references auth.users,
  avatar_url text
);

-- 2. Enable RLS
alter table profiles enable row level security;

-- 3. Create Policy
create policy "Users can delete a profile."
on profiles for delete
to authenticated                     -- the Postgres Role (recommended)
using ( auth.uid() = user_id );      -- the actual Policy

In this example, we create a table called profiles with columns id, user_id, and avatar_url. We then enable RLS on the profiles table using the alter table command. Finally, we create a policy called "Users can delete a profile" that allows authenticated users to delete a profile only if the user_id column matches their auth.uid(). This ensures that users can only delete their own profiles and not those of other users.

Create RLS : Enable all actions access for users based on their user Id
To enable all actions access for users based on their user Id, you can create a policy using the using clause. Here's an example of how to do this:

-- 1. Create table
create table profiles (
  id uuid primary key,
  user_id references auth.users,
  avatar_url text
);

-- 2. Enable RLS
alter table profiles enable row level security;

-- 3. Create Policy
create policy "Users can access their own profile."
on profiles for all
to authenticated                     -- the Postgres Role (recommended)
using ( auth.uid() = user_id );      -- the actual Policy

In this example, we create a table called profiles with columns id, user_id, and avatar_url. We then enable RLS on the profiles table using the alter table command. Finally, we create a policy called "Users can access their own profile" that allows authenticated users to perform all actions on a profile only if the user_id column matches their auth.uid(). This ensures that users can only access their own profiles and not those of other users.

Create RLS : Enable all actions access for users based on their user Id
To enable all actions access for users based on their user Id, you can create a policy using the using clause. Here's an example of how to do this:

-- 1. Create table
create table citiess (
  id uuid primary key,
  user_id references auth.users,
  avatar_url text
);

-- 2. Enable RLS
alter table citiess enable row level security;

-- 3. Create Policy
create policy "Users can access their own profile."
on citiess for all
to authenticated                     -- the Postgres Role (recommended)
using ( auth.uid() = user_id );      -- the actual Policy

In this example, we create a table called profiles with columns id, user_id, and avatar_url. We then enable RLS on the profiles table using the alter table command. Finally, we create a policy called "Users can access their own profile" that allows authenticated users to perform all actions on a profile only if the user_id column matches their auth.uid(). This ensures that users can only access their own profiles and not those of other users.



===================================

Create RLS : Enable all actions access for users based on their user Id
To enable RLS on a table, you can use the following SQL command:

ALTER TABLE table_name ENABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY;

Once you have enabled RLS, you can create policies that allow or disallow users to access and update data. To create a policy that enables all actions access for users based on their user ID, you can use the following SQL command:

CREATE POLICY policy_name ON table_name FOR ALL TO PUBLIC USING (user_id = auth.uid());

This policy will allow any user to perform all actions (SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE) on the table as long as the user_id column matches their auth.uid(). Note that auth.uid() is a function that returns the ID of the currently authenticated user.

Keep in mind that this policy will only work if you have enabled RLS on the table using the ENABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY command.

  using (auth = user_id);
In, we're creating called "Allow update" on the ` table policy allows users to inposts` table only `()` matches the `` column of the're trying to update means can only update their, and not posts created by otherOnce you've created, only be able to inposts` table if the in the policy. user update that they don't have permission to the fail.

Note that just an example, can policy to fit your case. You can policies for other access as`, `insert`, and `delete`.
